We work with a parsimonious specification of ordered binary choice regression that imposes a connection on sign predictability across different quantiles. The model forecasts the future conditional probability distributions of returns quite precisely when using a past indicator and past volatility proxy as predictors. Direct benefits of the model are revealed in an empirical application to 29 most liquid U.S. stocks. The forecast probability distribution is translated to significant economic gains in a simple trading strategy.

To cope with this problem we impose two structural assumptions onto the singular value decomposition of $\\Theta = U D V^{\\top}$. Firstly, the matrix with probabilities of connections between the nodes of a network has a rank much lower than the number of nodes. Therefore, there is limited amount of non-zero elements on the diagonal of $D$ and the whole operator admits a lower dimensional factorisation. Secondly, in observed social networks only a small portion of users are highly-affecting, leading to a sparsity regularization imposed on singular vectors $V.$\nUsing a novel dataset of 1069K messages from 30K users posted on the microblogging platform StockTwits during a 4-year period (01.2014-12.2018) and quantifying their opinions via natural language processing, we model their dynamic opinions network and further separate the network into communities.

Firstly we generate the initial value of the parameter beta by using Li, Y. and Zhu, J. (2008)`s L1 norm quantile regression function. Then we run a two-step iteration. For the first step of the iteration we use local polynomial regression to estimate the link function and its first derivative. For the second step of the iteration we apply Li and Zhu`s L1 norm quantile regression function again to estimate the parameter beta. This two two-step procedure iterates many times until the rate of convergence achieves. Then we input this final estimated beta into the local polynomial function again to calculate the final link function. The performance of the final estimated beta can be evaluated by three criteria: dev, acc and angle. The performance of the final estimated link function can be evaluated by two criteria: err and ase.

The F-test of testing equality of the coefficients to zero corresponds to the null of testing the marketing strategies having no effect. The output shows rejection of the null hypothesis.

The F-test of testing equality of the coefficients to zero corresponds to the null of testing the marketing strategies having no effect. The output shows rejection of the null hypothesis.

The data published here are artificial and only for the purpose to illustrate how the codes work. This thesis uses the concept of generalized quantiles to compute probabilistic forecasts of volume weighted average prices (VWAP) stemming from the German intraday market for electricity contracts. These prices exhibit extreme values in both directions and correlate inter- and intradaily. Dimensions are reduced by functional principal component and factorisable sparse tail event curve techniques. The dependency structure of the factor scores for generalized quantiles is analyzed with a VAR model that allows for incorporation of exogenous information such as renewable energy production forecasts. Price forecasts from both models are evaluated with root mean squared error and mean absolute error. Interval forecasts are evaluated, to which share the interval captures observed prices.

Performing the tests subsequently one can choose the largest interval that is not rejected for estimation in order to have the least variance with moderately small bias. The standard way to test homogeneity is via Change Point detection. The critical values can be estimated using Multiplier Bootstrap procedure Spokoiny, Zhilova (2013).

We deal with nonparametric estimation of the pricing kernel (PK) given by the ratio of the risk-neutral density estimator and the historical density (HD). The former density can be represented as the second derivative w.r.t. the European call option price function, which we estimate by nonparametric regression. HD is estimated nonparametrically too. In this framework, we develop the asymptotic distribution theory of the Empirical Pricing Kernel (EPK) in the L\u221e sense. Particularly, to evaluate the overall variation of the pricing kernel, we develop a uniform confidence band of the EPK. Furthermore, as an alternative to the asymptotic approach, we propose a bootstrap confidence band. The developed theory is helpful for testing parametric specifications of pricing kernels and has a direct extension to estimating risk aversion patterns. The established results are assessed and compared in a Monte-Carlo study. As a real application, we test risk aversion over time induced by the EPK.
