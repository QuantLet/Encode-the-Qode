While conventional stock analysis in FinTech targets at predicting\\nstock prices, less effort is made for profitable stock recommendation. Besides,\\nin existing approaches on modeling time series of stock prices, the\\nrelationships among stocks and sectors (i.e., categories of stocks) are either\\nneglected or pre-defined. Ignoring stock relationships will miss the\\ninformation shared between stocks while using pre-defined relationships cannot\\ndepict the latent interactions or influence of stock prices between stocks. In\\nthis work, we aim at recommending the top-K profitable stocks in terms of\\nreturn ratio using time series of stock prices and sector information. We\\npropose a novel deep learning-based model, Financial Graph Attention Networks\\n(FinGAT), to tackle the task under the setting that no pre-defined\\nrelationships between stocks are given. The idea of FinGAT is three-fold.\\nFirst, we devise a hierarchical learning component to learn short-term and\\nlong-term sequential patterns from stock time series. Second, a fully-connected\\ngraph between stocks and a fully-connected graph between sectors are\\nconstructed, along with graph attention networks, to learn the latent\\ninteractions among stocks and sectors. Third, a multi-task objective is devised\\nto jointly recommend the profitable stocks and predict the stock movement.\\nExperiments conducted on Taiwan Stock, S&P 500, and NASDAQ datasets exhibit\\nremarkable recommendation performance of our FinGAT, comparing to\\nstate-of-the-art methods.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["train_dataset_json = {'version' : '0.1.0',\n","                     'data' : [{'description': train['abstracts'].iloc[i],\n","                                'summary' : train['titles'].iloc[i]} for i in range(train.shape[0])]}\n","\n","test_dataset_json = {'version' : '0.1.0',\n","                     'data' : [{'description': test['abstracts'].iloc[i],\n","                                'summary' : test['titles'].iloc[i]} for i in range(test.shape[0])]}\n","\n","\n","\n","with open(f'{DATA_PATH}/preprocessed/ArXiv/arxiv_pretrain_train.json', 'w') as f:\n","    json.dump(train_dataset_json, f)\n","\n","with open(f'{DATA_PATH}/preprocessed/ArXiv/arxiv_pretrain_test.json', 'w') as f:\n","    json.dump(test_dataset_json, f)"],"metadata":{"id":"AAVPXdk_ZSFJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1690965738568,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4318,"user":{"displayName":"Elizaveta Zinovyeva","userId":"01253993997636551956"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]}]}
